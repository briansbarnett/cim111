                A strong hard ticket touring base is still vital to the success and longevity of any artist, but routed tours are especially vital to electronic artists who in theory could strictly stick to festivals. However, artists see a marked decline in engagement in markets not served by large festivals -- like Des Moines, Iowa and Little Rock, Arkansas.

                Electronic Music Festivals have become one of the world's most popular music event category. From Ultra Music Festival here in Miami (and around the World) to Tomorrowland in Belgium, we are seeing consistent growth of the festival segment and a broadening range of ages attending the events. Sponsorship spend is up as well, as we see worldwide brands such as AB Inbev, Constellation Brands and Red Bull all participating in the culture.
