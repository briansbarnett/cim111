                The process for recording electronic music is vastly different from any other genre. Producers use DAWs (digital audio workstations) and various audio plugins to create sounds that when put together create something much more than the sum of its parts.

                Electronic Music (not surprisingly) lives almost entirely on the internet. Many attribute its meteoric rise to ubiquity to the rise of the internet and audio streaming. The likes of SoundCloud, MixCloud, Spotify and Apple Music have all contributed to crafting the genre as we know it today.
