			<h1>Zedd</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Multi-platinum, GRAMMY award-winning artist/DJ/producer Zedd made his debut with Clarity after signing with Interscope in 2012 and has been breaking down barriers surrounding music genres ever since. With his latest single, Get Low with Liam Payne, Zedd ventures into a more urban musical domain that Entertainment Weekly called a sizzling summer jam and is quickly climbing the charts at Top 40 Radio. Earlier this year, Zedd teamed up with Alessia Cara to record Stay, a track that veers into a new direction for both artists, and landed Zedd his first #1 at Top 40. Zedd also single-handedly organized WELCOME!, an ACLU fundraising concert with a lineup that spans the music spectrum. As an immigrant himself, born in Russia and raised in Germany, the concert was born out of Zedd's desire to stand up for basic human rights and 100% of its profits benefitted the ACLU.
<br><br>
				Throughout his career, Zedd has worked with a diverse range of artists, including Foxes on Clarity, which soared to No.2 on Top 40 and sold 2.6 million copies, and Hayley Williams on Platinum hit Stay The Night, which racked up more than 400 million streams. In 2015, Zedd released True Colors, which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart, No. 1 on the Dance/Electronic Albums chart, and earned Zedd a 2016 Billboard Music Award for Best Dance Album. Its lead single I Want You to Know (ft. Selena Gomez) spent four weeks at No. 1 on Billboardâ€™s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart and has been certified Platinum, while second single, Beautiful Now (feat. Jon Bellion), has been certified Gold. In 2016, Zedd teamed up with Aloe Blacc on Candyman to kick off M&M's 75th anniversary celebration and released smash hit Starving featuring Hailee Steinfeld and Grey, which soared to top 10 on Top 40 radio and amassed over 240 million plays on Spotify alone in just four months.</p>
